# Processor-Design
The repository consists of a complete processor architecture.

1. It starts with MIPS code in assembly language which does a basic bubble sort operation
2. The file `MARS_to_Bin.py` is used to convert the MARS Assembly code to Binary code.
3. The remaining pythoon files take that binary code and perform the operation specified by the binary code in pipelined and non-pipelined fashion.
